                    <p>Shopping malls are not only places to shop; they also have become places for having fun and spending time. 
                    Consumers spend a considerable time in shopping malls because they host a lot of stores and 
                    activities that attract consumers' attention and offer a lot of benefits. 
                    A shopping centre is a collection of independent retail stores, services, and a parking area conceived, 
                    constructed, and maintained by a management firm as a unit. Shopping centres may also contain restaurants, 
                    banks, theatres, professional offices, service stations, and other establishments.</p>

                    <p>There are six factors that affect a mall's success: comfort, diversity, luxury, mall essence, 
                    entertainment and convenience. These factors match up well with the criteria we at tvsdesign use when 
                    identifying needed renovations for malls that are beginning to show their age</p>

                    <p><h5>In today's blog, we will be taking a look at the five features that will make your 
                    community shopping center stand out from the rest.</h5>
