                <p>Burger King (BK) is an American multinational chain of hamburger fast food restaurants. 
                Headquartered in Miami-Dade County, Florida, the company was founded in 1953 as Insta-Burger King, 
                a Jacksonville, Floridaâ€“based restaurant chain. 
                After Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties in 1954, 
                its two Miami-based franchisees David Edgerton and James McLamore purchased the 
                company and renamed it "Burger King". Over the next half-century, the company changed hands four times, 
                with its third set of owners, a partnership of TPG Capital, Bain Capital, 
                and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, taking it public in 2002. In late-2010, 
                3G Capital of Brazil acquired a majority stake in the company, in a deal valued at US$3.26 billion. 
                The new owners promptly initiated a restructuring of the company to reverse its fortunes. 3G, 
                along with partner Berkshire Hathaway, 
                eventually merged the company with the Canadian-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons, 
                under the auspices of a new Canadian-based parent company named Restaurant Brands International.
