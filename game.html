                A bit about our past
                
                The first GAME store opened in Durban, South Africa, in 1970. 
                It was born out of the belief by its founders that shopping had become a tedious and boring pastime. 
                They wanted to create a fun shopping environment and so conceptualized retailing as a game. 
                The signature shocking pink has still prevailed to this day.
                
                We operate out of 150 stores in 12 African countries.</p>
