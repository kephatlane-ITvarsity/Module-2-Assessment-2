                <p>Mr Price Group Limited is a publicly traded retail company based in South Africa. Founded in 1985, 
                Mr Price opened in 1987 after the owners bought a controlling interest in John Orrs Holdings, 
                whose trading divisions at the time were The Hub and Miladys.

                It is a cash-based, omni-channel retailer that sells its own-branded merchandise.

                African markets. It targets a wide range of customers and is well known for its fashion-value offering. 
                The groupâ€™s trading divisions have evolved over time which has expanded its offering to apparel, 
                cosmetics, homeware and sportswear merchandise through five trading divisions, namely: 
                Mr Price, Miladys, Mr Price Sport, Mr Price Home and Sheet Street. 
                It services its customers through its extensive store network as well as through its online platforms.
